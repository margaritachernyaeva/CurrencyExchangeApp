# CurrencyExchangeApp
It's a simple currency application, that provides up-to-date exchange rates for only 3 countries.

It's a project that represents me as a junior iOS developer. It includes my REST API using skills, a little bit of JSON knowledge and also my understanding of how MVVM works.
During the time of raising my programming skills I will upgrade this project and try to do my best to make this app better.
